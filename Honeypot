üõ°Ô∏è AWS Cybersecurity Lab with Bastion Host and Cowrie Honeypot

This project sets up a secure AWS cybersecurity lab with:

A Bastion Host (jump server) for controlled SSH access into private subnets

A Cowrie Honeypot running on a private EC2 instance to simulate a vulnerable system for attack logging and analysis

üìê Architecture Overview

[Internet]
    |
  [Bastion EC2] (Public Subnet)
    |
 [Private Subnet]
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [Cowrie Honeypot EC2] (no public IP)

Bastion Host: Acts as the only entry point for SSH access, preventing direct public access to sensitive machines

Honeypot (Cowrie): Simulates a vulnerable SSH service to attract and log malicious behavior

üî® Lab Setup Details

VPC Setup (from initial AWS script):

1 VPC with:

Public subnet (for Bastion EC2)

Private subnet (for Honeypot EC2)

NAT Gateway to allow outbound internet access from the private subnet

New Components Added:

Bastion Host EC2 in public subnet

Ubuntu AMI

Inbound: SSH (port 22) from your IP

Outbound: All traffic to private subnet

Cowrie Honeypot EC2 in private subnet

Ubuntu AMI

Inbound: SSH (port 2222) from Bastion Host security group only

No public IP

üß© Step-by-Step: Adding Bastion Host

1. Create Bastion EC2 Instance

Use Ubuntu Server 22.04

Place it in the public subnet

Allow SSH from your IP only (port 22)

2. Create Security Group for Bastion

Inbound:

SSH (22) from your_ip/32

Outbound:

All traffic (or restrict to the private subnet CIDR block)

3. SSH Into Bastion

ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@<bastion-public-ip>

4. Create Security Group for Cowrie EC2

Inbound:

TCP 2222 from Bastion security group

Outbound:

Allow internet (or use NAT Gateway)

5. SSH Into Cowrie from Bastion

ssh ubuntu@<honeypot-private-ip> -p 2222

üêç Cowrie Honeypot Setup (Private EC2)

sudo apt update && sudo apt install git python3-venv -y
git clone https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie
cd cowrie
python3 -m venv cowrie-env
source cowrie-env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp etc/cowrie.cfg.dist etc/cowrie.cfg
bin/cowrie start

To view logs:

cd var/log/cowrie
tail -f cowrie.log

üîê Optional Security Group Rule

To further restrict Bastion access:

Create a Network ACL or Security Group rule that limits egress from Bastion EC2 only to port 2222 on the honeypot's private IP.

üìà Future Enhancements

‚úÖ Integrate Security Onion for network traffic monitoring

‚úÖ Forward Cowrie logs to ELK Stack or Splunk

‚úÖ Add an attacker VM in private subnet for red team exercises

üíº Why This Matters

This lab demonstrates:

Secure VPC design with public/private subnet separation

Controlled access using a Bastion host

Threat detection via Cowrie honeypot

Realistic SOC environment simulation
